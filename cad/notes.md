My naming convention for CAD files:

- `partname_xp{num}` is experimental prototype number `{num}`. eg. `faceplate_xp1`. TP is used for first attempt prototypes to test and adjust (if needed) the dimensions, geometry, or functionality of the model.
- `partname_vp{num}` is validation prototype `{num}`. VP is used for parts that are nearly complete with correct dimensions and are being tested for physical characteristics such as fit, durability, stiffness, etc.
- `partname` is a finished, validated part.
